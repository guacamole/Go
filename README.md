# Go
Let's Go
#### Getting Started with Go
* First step will be installing Go on your machine
* I followed the instructions by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-go-on-ubuntu-18-04) on how to install go on your machine and got a stable version of Go from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/)

>I am a complete beginner and i don't know much about how things work around here in Tech. I am just reading the books and practicing at [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org) and it's working just fine for me. Believe me if I can Go, you can Go too!
